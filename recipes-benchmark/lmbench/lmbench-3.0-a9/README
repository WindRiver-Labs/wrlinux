WRLinux performance test with LMBench test suit

Test steps:
===========
[On build server]
1) $ configure \
--enable-board=intel_x86-64 --enable-kernel=standard --enable-rootfs=glibc_std \
--enable-test=yes

$ make fs

After building, lmbench binaries will be installed in ${prjdir}/export/dist/usr/bin
and the test scripts will be installed in ${prjdir}/export/dist/opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench directory.

2) boot target
Roofs on local storage (such as harddisk) is strongly recommended for benchmark test.

[On target]
3) Test scripts are installed in /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench directory, read help info and setup necessary variables before testing.
$ /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/wr-lmbench-test.sh -h

4) run test
$ /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/wr-lmbench-test.sh

Test logs will be redirected into /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/logs/ directory.

5) Analyze test logs.

Note: there are some variables used in /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench script.
$LMBENCH_BIN_PATH:
The path where the lmbench binaries are, which is /usr/bin in wrlinux by default.

$MB:
The memory size (in megabytes) used for testing, which will be auto detected if not set.

$FSDIR:
Directory to create and delete temporary files used in the testing, default to /usr/tmp.

$SYNC_MAX:
The number of child processes running the same benchmark that should be run in parallel.
Default to 1 in this test.

$STAT:
A small temporary file used for some cases such as stat, fstat, open2close.

$HALF:
Half of the memory size used for testing, which is used by bcopy test case.

$FILE:
Regular file generated by lmdd and saved in TMPDIR, which is /usr/tmp/ by default.
It is used by mmap or file_read test cases.

Upload test result:
===================
Test results of lmbench cases can be uploaded to benchmark database,
which is managed by Li,Fupan (fupan.li@windriver.com).

1) Process test logs.
$ cd /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench
$ ./generate_report.sh -d path_to_test_logs

2) create config file for the test
$ cd /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/config
$ cp template your_test_config

Edit your_test_config file, which includes variables required benchmark database.
For example:
-------config---------
## case_name : test suite/case name
case_name="lmbench"

## board: target name
board="intel-x86-64"

## test_id: unique name for each test run, which is used by database to manage test results
## recommend naming style: OS-kernel-rootfs-others
test_id="wrlinux7.0-standard-glibc_std"
-------end------------

3) upload test results to database
$ ./upload.sh -c config/your_test_config  -d temp_dir_for_dealt_logs

Then test results will be uploaed in database.
