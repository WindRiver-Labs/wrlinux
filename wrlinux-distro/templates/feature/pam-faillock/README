pam-faillock
==========

The pam_faillock PAM module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can reset
count on success, can deny access if too many attempts fail.

Template pam-faillock enable pam_faillock PAM module by default.

Notes
==========
* pam-faillock doesn't work well with 'ssh_allow_empty_password' which is
  added by IMAGE_FEATURES 'allow-empty-password' or 'debug-tweaks':

  When a user with non-empty password tries to login with ssh, it will be
  treated as a failed attempt before entering password and the login will
  be denied for n seconds according to the lock_time setting:

  "lock_time=n   Always deny for n seconds after failed attempt."

  So add a banner message with suggestion for the user.
