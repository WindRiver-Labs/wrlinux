Enable kernel EDAC drivers and its dependencies and userspace helper

This template is used to enable kernel feature features/edac/edac-enable.scc
which includes kernel config fragments CONFIG_EDAC and CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG and
their dependencies.

CONFIG_EDAC is a subsystem along with hardware-specific drivers designed to report
hardware errors. These are low-level errors that are reported in the CPU or
supporting chipset or other subsystems: memory errors, cache errors, PCI errors,
thermal throttling, etc..

CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG turns on debugging information for the entire EDAC subsystem.
You do so by inserting edac_module with "edac_debug_level=x." Valid levels are
0-4 (from low to high) and by default it is set to 2.
