OpenSSL No Weak Ciphers
=======================
OpenSSL contains some weak ciphers. This template disables some of them with
below configuration of openssl:

EXTRA_OECONF += "no-des"

Some deprecated crypto algorithms are disabled by default with the following
configuration in openembedded-core:

DEPRECATED_CRYPTO_FLAGS = "no-ssl no-idea no-rc5 no-md2 no-camellia no-mdc2 \
                           no-scrypt no-seed no-siphash no-sm2 no-sm3 no-sm4"

Important notes
===============
If this template is enabled, the application package which depends on openssl
may fail to build for some source codes are not handled well, for example, the
DES related codes are not wrapped in "#ifndef OPENSSL_NO_DES" and "#endif".
