                                  CRIU 
                                  ----

1. Introduction
----------------

The criu template enables CRIU (Checkpoint Restore in Userspace) support in
the kernel and adds the criu package to the image.

Note that the criu package supports x86_64 only so far due to an upstream
limitation.

2. Usage
--------

The recipe will throw warning info about supported architectures, if it is being
built on supported arch, just ignore the warning.

Add this template to your configure line:
 --templates feature/criu

This will ensure the required kernel config values are set.

3. Installation
----------------

This template will include criu in the root filesystem. No additional installation
steps are required.
