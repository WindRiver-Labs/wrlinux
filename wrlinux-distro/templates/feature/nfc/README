Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and
similar devices to establish wireless communication with each other by
putting them together or bringing them into close proximity, no more than
a few inches. And expected applications include contactless transactions,
data exchange among NFC devices, or an unpowered NFC chip, called a "tag".

The WRLinux Near Field Communication (NFC) feature is required to integrate
userspace daemon(neard) and nfc kernel features, and provide a convenience
way to develop, test and validate NFC device drivers in WRLinux platform.

This document only covers the following information:

	- How to build WRLinux kernel and filesystem with NFC feature
	- How to use NFC daemon

please refer to Documentation/networking/nfc.txt, NFC website, and iso
website for more information about architecture overview, device driver
interface description, and protocols:

1. How to build WRLinux kernel and filesystem with NFC feature
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following command would start a project intel-x86-64 with NFC supported
on Shark Bay Ultrabook:

	# path_to_wrlinux-x/wrlinux/configure \
	  --enable-kernel=standard  \
	  --enable-rootfs=glibc_std+nfc \
	  --enable-board=intel-x86-64 \

	# make fs

2. How to use NFC daemon

	- Check if neard daemon launched as follows:

        # /etc/init.d/neard restart

	- nfctool can list, check, and sniff NFC devcies:

	# nfctool -l

	# nfctool -n -p both 1 -d nfc0
	Start polling on nfc0 as both initiator and target
