BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation
programs, and includes several useful tools and examples. It makes use of
extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature
that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1
and above.
