Consul is a service networking solution to connect and secure services across
any runtime platform and public or private cloud.

Consul provides several key features:

Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves
and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services
such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.

Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators
about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents
routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.

Key/Value Storage - A flexible key/value store enables storing dynamic
configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more. The
simple HTTP API makes it easy to use anywhere.

Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any
number of regions without complex configuration.

Service Segmentation - Consul Connect enables secure service-to-service
communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization.
