This template enables lttng tool set along with babeltrace as a trace converter
and processor.

The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation is an open source software toolkit
which you can use to simultaneously trace the Linux kernel, user applications,
and user libraries.

LTTng consists of:
 - Kernel modules to trace the Linux kernel.
 - Shared libraries to trace user applications written in C or C++.
 - A Python package to trace Python applications which use the standard logging
   package.
 - A kernel module to trace shell scripts and other user applications without a
   dedicated instrumentation mechanism.
 - Daemons and a command-line tool, lttng, to control the LTTng tracers.

Packages:
LTTng-tools: Libraries and command-line interface to control tracing sessions.
LTTng-UST: Libraries and Java/Python packages to trace user applications.
LTTng-modules: Linux kernel modules to trace the kernel.
babeltrace: an open-source trace converter and processor. The tool can convert
            from one trace format to another, possibly with one or more filters
            in the conversion path, and perform other operations depending on
            the command
python-core: used with Python bindings of babeltrace library
