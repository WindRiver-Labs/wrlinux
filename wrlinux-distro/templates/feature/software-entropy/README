This template adds the haveged package as a software entropy to the image.

The haveged package provides an easy-to-use, unpredictable random number
generator based upon an adaptation of the HAVEGE algorithm. Haveged was
created to remedy low-entropy conditions in the Linux random device that
can occur under some workloads, especially on headless servers.

Detail description can be found in:

To use the template, add "--templates feature/software-entropy" as a
setup option.
