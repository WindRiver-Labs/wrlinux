This template adds the kea package as a dhcp server to the image.

The kea package is the next generation of DHCP software developed
by ISC. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols along with
their extensions, e.g. prefix delegation and dynamic updates to
DNS.

Detail description can be found in:
http://kea.isc.org/wiki

To use the template, add "--templates feature/dhcp-server-kea" as a
setup option.
