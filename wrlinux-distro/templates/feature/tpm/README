===============
This feature enables tpm 1.2 support, including kernel option changes to enable tpm
drivers, and picking up packages trousers, tpm-tools, openssl-tpm-engine, tpm-quote-tools.
Note, testing package tss-testsuite isn't included in this feature.

TPM 1.2 packages
================
The following open-source packages are supported for TPM 1.2.

trousers v0.3.13
----------------
TrouSerS is an implementation of the Trusted Computing Group's Software Stack
(TSS) specification. You can use Trousers to write applications that make use

tpm-tools v1.3.8
----------------
The tpm-tools package contains commands to allow the platform administrator
the ability to manage and diagnose the platform TPM.  Additionally, the
package contains commands to utilize some of the capabilities available
in the TPM. See the tools manual pages in package for usage of the tools.

openssl-tpm-engine v0.4.2
-------------------------
openssl-tpm-engine is an OpenSSL secure engine based on TPM hardware.
For more information and how to use, see README in package source.

tpm-quote-tools v1.0.2

How to use TPM 1.2
==================
For TPM 1.2, the following typical steps can be performed to get the TPM
ready for use:

1. Clear and enable TPM from the BIOS.

2. Take TPM ownership.
     # tpm_takeownership -y -z

3. Change owner and SRK passwords. These password are used for the
   access permission to other functions including generate keys.
     # tpm_changeownerauth -z -s -o

Then, you can use the TPM for a specific need, such as key generation,
sealing encrypted data, etc.
