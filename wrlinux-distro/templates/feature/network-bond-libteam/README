This template adds the libteam package to image.

libteam - Library for controlling team network device

The Team softdev Linux driver provides a mechanism to team multiple
NICs (ports) into a single logical one (teamdev) at L2 layer.
This process is called "channel bonding", "Ethernet bonding", "channel
teaming", "link aggregation", etc. Bonding is already implemented in the
Linux kernel but the Team softdev Linux driver is modular, userspace
driven, very lean and efficient, and it does have some distinct
advantages over the kernel's bonding driver.

Detail description can be found in:
http://libteam.org

To use the template, add "--templates feature/network-bond-libteam" as
