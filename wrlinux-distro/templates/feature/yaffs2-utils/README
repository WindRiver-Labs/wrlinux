Enable kernel support for yaffs2 along with a userspace management tool
yaffs2-utils.

The yaffs2-utils is the collection of utilities to make/extract a YAFFS2/YAFFS1
image for Linux. Currently only the following tools are installed:
 - makeyaffsimage: Makes a YAFFS file system image that can be used to load up a
   file system.
 - makeyaffs2image: Makes a YAFFS2 file system image that can be used to load up
   a file system, with default Linux MTD layout.

Note that with the kernel feature of flash_fs.scc enabled in this template, we
would enable kernel support for other three flash file systems, jffs2 cramfs and
ubifs, at the same time.
