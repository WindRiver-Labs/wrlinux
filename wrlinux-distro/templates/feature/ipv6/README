Enable kernel support for IPv6 tunnel and IPSEC and userspace utilities

Kernel config fragments

CONFIG_IPV6
For general information about IPv6, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6.
For specific information about IPv6 under Linux, see
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt
and read the HOWTO at http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/

CONFIG_INET6_TUNNEL
Support for generic IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel transformation, which is required by the
IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling module as well as tunnel mode IPComp.

CONFIG_IPV6_TUNNEL
Support for IPv6-in-IPv6 and IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnels described in RFC 2473.

CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTER_PREF
This is an optional extension to the Router Advertisement message which improves
the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router, especially when the hosts
are placed in a multi-homed network.

CONFIG_XFRM
CONFIG_XFRM_USER
CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY
CONFIG_INET_AH
CONFIG_INET_ESP
CONFIG_INET_IPCOMP
CONFIG_INET6_AH
CONFIG_INET6_ESP
CONFIG_INET6_IPCOMP
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SEQIV
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CTR
CONFIG_CRYPTO_XCBC
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAMELLIA
These are for IPSEC, for more details please refer to
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/networking/ipsec.txt


Packages

netcat-openbsd
A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections
using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable 'back-end' tool that
can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same
time it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can
create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.


Distro feature

ipv6 is also defined as a distro feature set in DISTRO_FEATURES and used as
condition for additional configurations in other packages. Running the following
command would give you a general picture.
grep -rn --color '.*FEATURE.*ipv6.*' YOUR_LAYERS
