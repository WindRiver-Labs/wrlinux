TPM 2.0
=======

This feature enables Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) support, including 
kernel option changes to enable tpm drivers, and picking up TPM 2.0 packages.

Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) is a microcontroller that stores keys,
passwords, and digital certificates. A discrete TPM 2.0 offers the
capabilities as part of the overall platform security requirements.

TPM 2.0 packages
================

The following open-source packages are supported for TPM 2.0.

tpm2.0-tss
----------
The TPM2.0-TSS library from Intel, which provides support for applications
to utilize TPM 2.0 hardware. See README in package for more detailed
information. Project homepage:
    https://github.com/01org/TPM2.0-TSS

Visit TCG official website for TSS 2.0 API specification.

tpm2.0-tools
------------
The TPM 2.0 tools from Intel, based on TPM2.0-TSS library, contains commands
to manage and diagnose the TPM, and commands to utilize some of the
capabilities available in the TPM. For how to use, the manual file in package
is a good place to start. Project homepage:

Clear TPM
=========

For TPM 2.0, the following typical steps can be performed to get the TPM
ready for use:

1. Clear and enable TPM from the BIOS or set the security jumper on the board.

2. Take TPM ownership, setting Owner/Endorsement/Lockout passwords if
   necessary. These passwords are used for the authorization to certain
   TPM 2.0 commands.

     # tpm2_takeownership -o <ownerPasswd> -e <endorsePasswd> -l <lockPasswd>

Then, you can use the TPM for a specific need, such as key generation,
sealing encrypted data, etc.
