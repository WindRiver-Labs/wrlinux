                               ----------------------

Configure the build to create an initramfs image which will be integrated with
the kernel image. For additional information, please review the initramfs.txt
document found in the layers/wrlinux/Documentation directory.

Note, please do not try to configure feature/efi-secure-boot and
feature/initramfs-integrated simultaneously in a project, since efi-secure-boot
requires a seperated initramfs for security verification, so these two features
are not able to work with each other.
