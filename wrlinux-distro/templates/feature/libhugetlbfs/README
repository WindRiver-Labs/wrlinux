                                  --------------

1. Introduction
----------------

The libhugetlbfs template enables Huge TLB support in the kernel and adds the
libhugetlbfs package to the image.

Note that the libhugetlbfs package only supports x86, x86_64, powerpc and powerpc_64
architectures.

The necessary kernel support will be enabled although some BSPs may already
turn it on.

2. Usage
-------

Add this template to your configure line:
 --templates feature/libhugetlbfs

This will ensure the required kernel config values are set.

3. Installation
----------------

This template will include libhugetlbfs in the root filesystem. No additional 
installation steps are required.
