Enable LAMP packages and related dependencies.

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) is an archetypal model of web service stacks,
named as an acronym of the names of its original four open-source components:
the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL database
management system (MariaDB is used now), the PHP programming language.

The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original
selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites
and web applications.

Packages
1. modphp contains PHP module for the Apache HTTP server

2. phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of
operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases,
tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed
via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any
SQL statement.

3. The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

4. xdebug is used for debugging and profiling extension for PHP.
