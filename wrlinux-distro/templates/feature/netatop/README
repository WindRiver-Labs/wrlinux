The Linux kernel does not maintain counters for the number of network accesses
issued per process or per thread. As a consequence, it is not possible to
analyze which process and/or thread causes most load in case that atop shows a
high utilization on one of your network interfaces.

The optional kernel module netatop can be loaded to gather statistics about the
TCP and UDP packets that have been transmitted/received per process and per
thread. As soon as atop discovers that this module is active, it shows the
columns SNET and RNET in the generic screen for the number of transmitted and
received packets per process. When the 'n' key is pressed, it shows detailed
counters about the number packets transmitted/received via TCP and UDP, the
average sizes of these packets, and the total bandwidth consumed for input and
output per process/thread.
