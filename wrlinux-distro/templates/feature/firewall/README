Firewall
========

This feature ensures that the Linux network filter, iptables, is included
in the image. An initial, permissive default rule is used. The iptables
rules can be specified as desired to limit specific network traffic.

When combined with snort, this feature can provide not only a firewall, but
also network intrusion detection functionality.
