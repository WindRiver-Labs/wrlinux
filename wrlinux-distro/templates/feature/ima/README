Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)
========================================

The Linux IMA subsystem introduces hooks within the Linux kernel to support
measuring the integrity of files that are loaded (including application code)
before it is executed or mmap()ed to memory. The measured value (hash) is then
registered in a log that can be consulted by administrators.

Details please refer to meta-secure-core/meta-integrity/README.md.
