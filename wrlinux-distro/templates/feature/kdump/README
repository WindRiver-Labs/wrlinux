This template enables four related tools, as described below, which can be used
together to load a second kernel on purpose or on crash and analyze the dumped
data.

Kexec is a fast reboot feature that lets you reboot to a new Linux kernel. For
more details please refer to
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.rst

Kdump is a feature of the Linux kernel that creates crash dumps in the event of
a kernel crash. For more details please refer to
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/admin-guide/kdump/kdump.rst

Makedumpfile makes a small DUMPFILE by compressing data dumped by kdump or by
excluding unnecessary pages for analysis, or both.

Crash is a self-contained tool that can be used to investigate either live
systems, kernel core dumps created from the netdump, diskdump and kdump packages
from Red Hat Linux, the mcore kernel patch offered by Mission Critical Linux, or
the LKCD kernel patch. For details please refer to
