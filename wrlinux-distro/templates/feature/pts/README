This template adds phoronix-test-suite packages.

To use, add

--templates feature/pts

as a setup option.  The template adds the test suite to the file system
and also adds the target-toolchain feature so that tests can be compiled
on the target.

Unless you have included them by other means, the rootfs generated by including
this template will not contain any actual tests, and you will need internet
access to retrieve them from the phoronix site.
