This template adds the plymouth package as the splash screen provider
during boot to the image.

Plymouth is an application that runs very early in the boot process
(even before the root filesystem is mounted!) that provides a graphical
boot animation while the boot process happens in the background.

Detail description can be found in:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth

To use the template, add "--templates feature/plymouth" as a
setup option.
