This template will enable features and add packages for STIG compliance.

The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration
standards for devices/systems.
The STIGs contain technical guidance to "lock down" information systems/software
that might otherwise be vulnerable to a malicious computer attack.

To use the template, add "--templates feature/stig" as a setup option.
