This template will enable selinux in a given distribution.  For full use
you will need to provide a proper reference policy for selinux.

The standard meta-selinux providers are refpolicy-mcs, refpolicy-mls,
refpolicy-standard, refpolicy-minimum, refpolicy-targeted.

Note these standard policies will still require modification to function
properly in your configuration.w

In your local.conf file you need to set the preferred policy, such as:
  PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/refpolicy = "refpolicy-standard"
