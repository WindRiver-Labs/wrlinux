Enable ldconfig processing within the packages produced by this configuration.

When enabled, the packages that provide libraries will automatically run
'ldconfig' when installed.  This creates the ld.so.cache file, which the
dynamic loader uses to more quickly find the libraries to load.

The dynamic loader does NOT require ld.so.cache to run, and will
automatically follow the search paths for the libraries.
