# This include points at uninative tarballs generated and maintained
# by the Yocto Project. These file can be included by distros if they
# want to use/maintain a unified sstate feed for native/cross artefacts
# rather than the feeds having native/cross artefacts which are specific
# to the distro running on the build machine.
#
# To rebuild uninative tarball:
# - Set SDKMACHINE to "x86_64" or "i686"
# - $ bitbake uninative-tarball
# - Save tmp/deploy/sdk/${SDK_ARCH}-nativesdk-libc.tar.bz2 to a directory <uninative_dir>
# - Update UNINATIVE_URL to <uninative_dir>
# - Update UNINATIVE_CHECKSUM with "sha256sum ${SDK_ARCH}-nativesdk-libc.tar.bz2"
#
