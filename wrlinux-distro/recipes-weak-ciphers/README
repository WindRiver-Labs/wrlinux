recipes-weak-ciphers
====================

openssl provides a lot of ciphers and some of them have been deemed to be
weak. In recipes-weak-ciphers, openssl checks when distro feature
'openssl-no-weak-ciphers' exists and then disable the weak ciphers which
include 'des ec md2 mdc2' right now.

The other bbapends in recipes-weak-ciphers are to fix build errors when weak
ciphers in openssl are disabled.
