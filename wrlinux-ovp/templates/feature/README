# If you want to improve performance of real-time,
# you can enable rt-tune feature by doing followings
#
# Host:
# WRTEMPLATE += "feature/host-rt-tune" > conf/local.conf
# Guest:
# WRTEMPLATE += "feature/guest-rt-tune" > conf/local.conf
# 
# This may disable some configuration of kernel that would
# affect other modules. So it should be use with caution.
