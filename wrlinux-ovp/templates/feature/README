# If you want to reduce latency and improve real time, you can 
# enable rt-tune feature by doing the following.
#
# The first method:
#
# Build host:
# echo "WRTEMPLATE += \"feature/host-rt-tune\"" >> conf/local.conf
#
# Build guest:
# echo "WRTEMPLATE += \"feature/guest-rt-tune\"" >> conf/local.conf
# 
# The second method:
# (The cmdline only show how to enable rt-tune feature, you should 
# add other parameters according to your situation)
# 
# Host:
# setup.sh --templates feature/host-rt-tune 
#
# Guest:
# setup.sh --templates feature/guest-rt-tune  
# 
# This may disable some configuration of kernel that would
# affect other modules. So it should be used with caution.
