This template enables a series of kernel config fragments which are expected to
reduce real-time kernel response latency for a host system in a virtualization
environment.

The general idea is to turn off kernel options that might introduce latency. See
inline comments in feature/files/rt-latency-host.cfg for details. For more
details of real-time kernel please refer to
https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/start

Note that there are various ways to tune the latency of real-time kernel via
kernel config fragments and boot parameters and etc. Those configurations and
parameters may vary from system to system to gain an expected result and thus
they may change as kernel and/or hardware change.

No guarantee of latency and performance can be made by using this template.
