Instructs RPM to look on the local disk for Armored PGP keys when needed.

Using the Keyring Path support, we point rpm to a local directory where
it can read the keys when requested. This can make it easier for external
programs to manage the keys that RPM uses to validate packages.   (When
used with the feature/rpm-required-sig, it can be used to more easily make
keys available to RPM for authorization to install.)

The local keys should be installed into /etc/rpm/keys/ (you may have to 
create the directory.)  The format of the key filename is ASCII armored
file.  You can get the log key, using:

$ gpg --list-keys

pub   2048R/5D64AD52 2015-10-14
uid                  testuser (nocomment) <testuser@testemail.com>
sub   2048R/CBE5FB13 2015-10-14

The key can exported using:

$ gpg --export -a "testuser" > test.key

and then copied onto the target into '/etc/rpm/keys'.
