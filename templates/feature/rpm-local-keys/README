Instructs RPM to look on the local disk for Armored PGP keys when needed.

Using the HKP support, instead of pointing to an external server, we point
rpm to a local directory where it can read the keys when requested.  This
can make it easier for external programs to manage the keys that RPM uses
to validate packages.  (When used with the feature/rpm-required-sig, it 
can be used to more easily make keys available to RPM for authorization to
install.)

The local keys should be installed into /etc/rpm/keys/ (you may have to 
create the directory.)  The format of the key filename is (all lowercase)
'0x<long key id>'.  You can get the log key id, using:

$ gpg2 --keyid-format=0xlong --list-keys

pub   2048R/0xCDB3BC792BF72D35 2015-05-26
uid                 [ultimate] Test RPM Signing Key (Test key) <test@localhost.local>
sub   2048R/0xBB8ED715EA922778 2015-05-26


The key can exported using:

$ gpg2 --export -a 'Test RPM Signing Key' > 0xcdb3bc792bf72d35

and then copied onto the target into '/etc/rpm/keys'.
