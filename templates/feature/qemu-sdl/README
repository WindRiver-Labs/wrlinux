This feature causes native qemu to build with SDL support.
It's disabled by default, so users might encounter the problem of qemu-native
hanging on graphic console on remote servers.

To enable it, add

--templates feature/qemu-sdl

as a setup option.

As a known issue, SLED 11 servers cannot build qemu-native with this template
enabled. The root cause is that SLED 11 has old and broken libxcb-xlib. So
we would have errors like below.

/usr/lib64/libxcb-xlib.so.0: undefined reference to `_xcb_unlock_io'
/usr/lib64/libxcb-xlib.so.0: undefined reference to `_xcb_lock_io'
