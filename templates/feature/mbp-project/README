  Managed Build Project

The Managed Build Project is a set of proceses and procedures that define
how to create, manage, update and deploy package level updates in a custom
defined distribution.

See the guide on the knowledge library for creating a managed build project.

The template enables some common steps that help limit the 'hash value'
changes that the build system normally detects.  It changes settings such as
definiting a generic version for the toolchain items.  This prevents a
mandatory rebuild whent he product version has been updated.

It also skips some rebuilds when certain recipes change.  This is because it
is known that when the recipes change, their dependencies rarely require a
rebuild.  Things like busybox would fall under this.  See the template.conf
file for a full list of excluded items.
