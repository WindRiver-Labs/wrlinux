This template adds ptest (package-test) functionality.  This includes the
'ptest' DISTRO_FEATURE, a 'ptest-pkgs' option to EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES, and the
ptest-runner package, used for running the full ptest suite.

To use, add

--templates feature/ptest

as a setup option.

The scripts/ subdirectory contains ptest-related tools.
