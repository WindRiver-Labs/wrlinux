This template adds acl as a distro feature.

To use, add it as a template:

  --templates feature/acl

If you want packages to support acl you should check that
it is a distro feature.  These packages do that:

strace_4.8.bb
coreutils_6.9.bb
coreutils_8.21.bb
libarchive_2.8.5.bb

Some packages explicitly disable acl support:

rsync_3.0.9.bb
sed_4.2.2.bb
gettext_0.18.2.bb

acl can be, and sometimes is, checked for during package
configuration.  This is not a good idea in a cross-compile
environment.  We want to explicitly enable or disable support
and specify a DEPENDS on acl when we want it.
