This feature causes the root filesystem to be mounted read-only with writable
data (directories under /var) located on a ram disk.

This feature is only expected to work on 'small' and 'standard' root
filesystems.  Packages added by SATO or added manually may need to be
updated by hand to work with a read-only root filesystem.

To use, add

--templates feature/readonly-root

as a setup option.
