OSTree (libostree)
==================

Enable ostree which fundamentally changes the way you will update the
target device file system.

You should always set the OSTREE_REMOTE_URL in your local.conf so that
it is built into the target image for later updating.  This will be
the location which you copy the ostree_repo from your deploy
directory.

The ostree integration modifies the following aspects of your image:
  * The disk layout will be altered to use an A/B or A only layout
    depending on the value of ${OSTREE_USE_AB}
     1) OSTREE_USE_AB = 1  - Use the A/B layout
         * FAT partition for the bootloader
	 * primary "A" /boot partition for the kernel and initramfs
	 * primary "A" / partition for the OS and the local ostree_repo
	 * secondary "B" /boot partition for the kernel and initramfs
	 * secondary "B" /  partition for the OS and the local ostree_repo
	 * /var partition which auto expands to fill the physical disk for data
     1) OSTREE_USE_AB = 0  - Use the A layout
         * FAT partition for the bootloader
	 * primary "A" /boot partition for the kernel and initramfs
	 * primary "A" / partition for the OS and the local ostree_repo
	   - In the A layout the rollback deployment data is stored on the same partition
	 * /var partition which auto expands to fill the physical disk for data

  * The bootloader configuration is altered to support a primary boot
    and rollback boot deployment.  A boot counter is stored in the FAT volume
    to automatically boot the rollback image if too many failures have occurred. 

  * The initramfs is replaced with the ostree_initramfs which is capable of creating
    a new deployment using the network or local storage

  * The file system is built with the usrmerge feature which makes /bin /sbin and /lib
    links into the /usr directory

  * The /etc and /var directories are the only directories which are writable in an
    OSTree based file system.  This is where any persistent data should stored

  * Each upgrade will perform 3-way merge on the /etc directory

  * You should use the ostree_upgrade.sh script to upgrade the device

With each build of an image, an ostree repository will be created in
the tmp*/deploy/images/$MACHINE/ostree_repo directory.  This
repository will be used to create a local repository inside the image,
from which a "deployment" will be checked out for use as the OS.

The wr-ostree layer also provides an initial image deployment tool
called bootfs.sh.  You can see the help message by running the
following from your project directory, assuming you created inside the
directory where you ran setup.sh:

   ../layers/wr-ostree/scripts/bootfs.sh -h

The initial deployment tool will create a ustart.img file which can be
copied to boot media or media which will be a permanent part of the
device.  The OSTREE_REMOTE_URL must be defined in the local.conf in
order to perform a network deployment.  The bootfs.sh tool can
generate an image which contains the ostree_repo which will be
deployed on the first boot, or it can use the network as the point to
retrieve the data in the ostree_repo.
