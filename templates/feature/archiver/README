This template adds an additional step to recipe building. It creates
archive for the sources of:
 1) original (or unpacked) source: ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "original" (default)
    It also includes the original patch files, but the tar ball contains
    patches between do_unpack and do_patch no longer provided.
    In this situation ARCHIVER_MODE[diff] = "1" doesn't work.
 2) patched source: ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "patched"
 3) configured source: ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "configured"
 4) The patches between do_unpack and do_patch:
    ARCHIVER_MODE[diff] = "1"
    And you can set the one that you'd like to exclude from the diff:
    ARCHIVER_MODE[diff-exclude] ?= ".pc autom4te.cache patches"
 5) The environment data, similar to 'bitbake -e recipe':
    ARCHIVER_MODE[dumpdata] = "1"
 6) The recipe (.bb and .inc): ARCHIVER_MODE[recipe] = "1"
 7) Whether output the .src.rpm package:
    ARCHIVER_MODE[srpm] = "1"
 8) Filter the license, the recipe whose license in
    COPYLEFT_LICENSE_INCLUDE will be included, and in
    COPYLEFT_LICENSE_EXCLUDE will be excluded.
    COPYLEFT_LICENSE_INCLUDE = 'GPL* LGPL*'
    COPYLEFT_LICENSE_EXCLUDE = 'CLOSED Proprietary'
 9) The recipe type that will be archived:
    COPYLEFT_RECIPE_TYPES = 'target'

Example:
1. To use this template, add "--templates feature/archiver" to your
   setup options:
$ wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machine qemux86-64 \
 --kernel standard \
 --templates feature/archiver

2. Build a package, such as 'bash':
$ bitbake bash

3. The result is copyed to tmp-glibc/deploy/sources:
$ ls tmp-glibc/deploy/sources/x86_64-wrs-linux/bash-4.4-r0/ -1
0001-help-fix-printf-format-security-warning.patch

mkbuiltins_have_stringize.patch

test-output.patch

4. Append ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "configured" and
   ARCHIVER_MODE[diff] = "1" to local.conf

5. Rebuild 'bash':
$ bitbake bash -ccleansstate && bitbake bash

6. Check result:
$ ls tmp-glibc/deploy/sources/x86_64-wrs-linux/bash-4.4-r0/ -1
bash-4.4-r0-configured.tar.gz
bash-4.4-r0-diff.gz
