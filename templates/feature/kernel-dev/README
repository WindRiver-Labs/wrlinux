This template will include the kernel-dev, kernel-devsrc in the SDK.

This will allow an SDK to have the necessary support to build out-of-tree
kernel modules.

To use this feature to build out-of-tree kernel modules you would need to
run through the following steps:

1) Install the generate SDK

2) source the environment file for the primary multilib, such as:
  $ . ./environment-setup-armv5e-wrs-linux-gnueabi

3) Change to the kernel source directory:
  $ cd ${SDKTARGETSYSROOT}/usr/src/kernel

4) Prep the kernel scripts
  $ make scripts

5) Prepare the kernel module source as necessary, such as:
  From: http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/07/write-linux-kernel-module
  (starting at section 'II')

  (step #1 was accomplished by step #1 - #4 above)

  download the source from step #2

  download the makefile from step #3
  Change the makefile, references to:
  /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
    to
  ${SDKTARGETSYSROOT}/usr/src/kernel

  copy the resulting hello.ko to a running target

  (verify functionality with step #4)
