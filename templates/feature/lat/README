Wind River Assembly Tool
========================

Phase 1 - Create Full Image Generator

The current full image generation for the OSTree uses two bbclasses
and an the result of the typical image recipe generation from the
OE-Core.

We need to be able to assemble full images using only the RPM packages,
and pass the resulting file system(s) to the WIC tool like is done in
the bootfs.sh tool which can generate the ustart.img images. Any new
image that is generated should be able to be checked into an OSTree
branch, much like what happens when you build core-image-minimal for
example from a build with the feature/ostree.

The important part here is that you do not have to use bitbake to
create an image.

The package list for the new images can be specified in a yaml file
along with any other scripts that may need to be executed to finalize
an image.
