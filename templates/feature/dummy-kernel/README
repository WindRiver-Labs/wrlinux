This template causes the build to use the linux-dummy
kernel, a standin for virtual/kernel which provides no
real kernel, but satisfies dependancies on virtual/kernel.
Useful when the build does not require a kernel, such as
when building containers, saving build time.

#@TYPE: Wrtemplate
#@NAME: dummy-kernel
#@DESCRIPTION: This template allows the build to use the linux-dummy kernel, which provides no real kernel, but satisfies dependancies on virtual/kernel. This is useful when the build does not require a kernel, such as when building containers, saving build time as a result.
