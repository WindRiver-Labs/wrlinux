Using virtio in KVM

Summary
   This usecase is intended to provide a simple demo how to use virtio
   for KVM in Wind River Linux. It also includes virtio networking
   examples.

Terminology:

   In a system where code is running in multiple OS environments, it
   is easy to get confused about what we are building and running
   on. To minimize this confusion, this document specifically refers
   to 3 general environments: 

     BUILD HOST: The computer/OS where all code is compiled. 

     KVM HOST: This is the primary OS running on the target
     machine, whether it is actual hardware or a QEMU emulation. 

     KVM GUEST: This is the OS that is running in (in the case of
     this example) a QEMU emulation running on the KVM HOST. 

Scenarios
   virtio is a series of efficient, well-maintained Linux drivers which can
   be adapted for various different hypervisor implementations using a shim
   layer. This includes a simple extensible feature mechanism for each driver.
   it also provides an obvious ring buffer transport implementation called
   vring, etc.

   This demonstration builds a KVM HOST kernel (on the BUILD HOST)
   that runs on physical hardware. The KVM GUEST kernel is built (on
   the BUILD HOST) and started in a QEMU emulation on the KVM
   HOST. Finally, the various features of the virtio demonstration are
   exercised between the KVM HOST and KVM GUEST. The 'netperf'
   application is used to demonstrate the data transfer rate via the
   virtio device driver. Macvtap and vhostnet are used here for virtio
   networking.  

Preconditions and Assumptions

   - Wind River Linux 10.0 or newer

   - BSPs built with the configurations shown.
 
   - This example uses two separate Operating Systems running on the
     same target hardware. These systems are referred to as the Host
     and Guest OS. The Host environment is assumed to be implemented
     as a 64-bit BSP. The Guest can be either 32- or 64-bit, but for
     this example we will use a 64-bit BSP.

   - It is necessary for the user to acknowledge the non-free license
     associated with the 'netperf'. The mechanism for doing this is
     described below.

   - Since the 'netperf' application must be downloaded, adding the
     netperf package overrides the setting of BB_NO_NETWORK in the
     local.conf file.
     
Normal Execution Flow

KVM HOST preparation

   1. Setup your a new build project by selecting either intel-x86-64 or qemux86-64
   BSP, also enable the template feature/libvirt.  See the product documentation for
   the steps to do this.

   2. Acknowledge the non-free license status of the 'netperf' package.

      Add the setting of the LICENSE_FLAGS variable in the netperf
      bitbake recipe at:

       meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-support/netperf/netperf_2.6.0.bb

      to the LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST variable in the local.conf file.

      For example, if LICENSE_FLAGS = "non-commercial", set

       LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "non-commercial"

      in the local.conf file.

   3. Turn on CONFIG_MACVLAN and CONFIG_MACVTAP
      To use MacVTap for networking. Make sure these two options are 
      enabled in host kernel. If they are modules, please load them.

   4. Build the KVM HOST bsp:

      $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std

   5. Deploy the kernel and rootfs to your target.

      Details of this process will depend on the particular target
      hardware and network configuration and are beyond the scope of
      this document.

KVM GUEST preparation

   1. Setup your a new build project by selecting intel-x86-64 BSP, also 
   enable the template feature/libvirt.  See the product documentation for
   the steps to do this.

   2. Acknowledge the non-free license status of the 'netperf' package.

      Add the setting of the LICENSE_FLAGS variable in the netperf
      bitbake recipe at:

      meta-openembedded/meta-networking/recipes-support/netperf/netperf_2.6.0.bb

      to the LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST variable in the local.conf file.

      For example, if LICENSE_FLAGS = "non-commercial", set

       LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "non-commercial"

      in the local.conf file.

   3. Add the following package to the BSP:

      netperf (provided by the meta-networking layer)

      This can be done by editing conf/local.conf
      directly to add:

	  IMAGE_INSTALL += "netperf"
	  PNWHITELIST_networking-layer_append = " netperf "

   4. Build the KVM GUEST bsp:

      $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std

   5. Copy bzImage and wrlinux-image-std-x86-64-kvm-guest.ext4
      to /root directory on the KVM HOST.

Demonstration

   1. Boot the KVM HOST. On the booted KVM HOST:

      root@wrlinux:~# modprobe kvm
      root@wrlinux:~# modprobe kvm-intel

   2. Configure the macvtap interface:

      root@wrlinux:~# ip link add link eth0 name macvtap0 type macvtap
      root@wrlinux:~# ip link set macvtap0 address 1a:46:0b:ca:bc:7b up
      root@wrlinux:~# ip link show macvtap0
      7: macvtap0@eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 \
      qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT qlen 500 link/ether \
      1a:46:0b:ca:bc:7b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

   3. Verify that the macvtap driver is included in the KVM HOST
      kernel and the tap device is available:

      root@wrlinux:~# dmesg | grep macv
      macvtap0: no IPv6 routers present

      root@wrlinux:~# ls /dev/tap*
      /dev/tap7

   4. On KVM HOST, run netperf program before booting KVM GUEST
      It is located at /etc/init.d/netperf

      root@wrlinux:~# /etc/init.d/netperf start

   5. On the KVM HOST, boot the KVM GUEST with the following
      command:

      root@wrlinux:~# qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -k en-us -m 1024 \
      -net user,hostname="kvm-guest" \
      -net nic,macaddr=1a:46:0b:ca:bc:7b,model=virtio \
      -net tap,fd=3 3<>/dev/tap7 \
      -drive file=wrlinux-image-std-x86-64-kvm-guest.ext4,if=virtio,format=raw \
      -kernel bzImage \
      -append "root=/dev/vda rw console=ttyS0,115200"

   6. Start the guest network interface with:

      root@localhost:~# ifconfig eth0 10.0.2.15

   7. Running netperf:
        
      On the KVM GUEST, run netperf using 10.0.2.2. as the host IP.      

      root@kvm-guest:~# netperf -H 10.0.2.2 -l 60

Notes:

   1. This example uses a 'glibc_std' root filesystem and has not been
   tested on 'glibc_small'. The base configuration of 'glibc_small' is
   lacking a number of necessary components. It may be possible to
   include the necessary components by reconfiguring 'busybox', but
   this is not supported.

   2. Please refer to README that accompanies the netperf download for
   more information about the design and use of netperf.
