        QEMU-mips Board Support Package

1. About this document
======================

This document contains common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the qemumips layer
---------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

2. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp/work-shared/<machine>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


3. Boot Instructions
====================

Since this BSP is targeted to a QEMU simulated board, run the command
below in the project directory to run the BSP on top of QEMU:

$ bitbake wrlinux-image-glibc-std


3.1 Ext4 Root File System
------------------------

By default, the guest system running in QEMU uses ext4 rootfs.

3.2 RAM Root File System (initramfs)
---------------------------------

3.2.1 Create the initrd image
-----------------------------

Build the gzip'd initramfs image with:

$ bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs

The resulting file can be found at 
tmp/deploy/images/qemumips/wrlinux-image-initramfs-<machine>.cpio.gz

3.2.2 Deployment
----------------
3.2.2 Deployment
----------------

After compiling copmpletely, using the command: 

$  runqemu qemumips slirp nographic cpio.gz

to boot it from initramfs.

4. Target Notes
===============

4.1 OProfile
============
This BSP does not have a usable implementation of hardware performance
counters, so OProfile must be used in timer mode. If you are
using OProfile you need to add "oprofile.timer=1" to your kernel boot
options.

4.2 Memory Limit
================
Memory size is limited to 256MiB with a 32-bit kernel.

4.3 QEMU GDB Backend
====================
QEMU only maps MIPS TLBs at certain times, making virtual address
mapping unreliable. To work around this behavior, it is recommended that
you either build module code into the kernel or make use of KGDBoE
to debug kernel modules.
