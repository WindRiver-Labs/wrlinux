wr-app-container
-------------------------

The wrlinux layer comes with a single 'flexible' image called
'wr-app-container'. This image allows you to build a single
application container where you select the application which the image
will contain. Application selection is made via local.conf, by setting
'WR_APP_CONTAINER_APP' to the name of the application.


Building
-------------------------

The image is built using the normal bitbake commands:
%> bitbake wr-app-container

The output will be found in the tmp/deploy/images/* directory
alongside the other images.


Usage
-------------------------

Once built you would normally want to deploy the container image for
use with OverC or Docker.

For OverC this would be done by copying the container image tarball to
the target running OverC and then running the following commands on
dom0 or in a container with bindings to dom0:

# c3 add -n app-container wr-app-container-genericx86-64.tar.bz2
# c3 cfg -o /opt/container/app-container set app:/usr/bin/<your_app> [options]
# c3 start [options] app-container

If using docker you would make use of the resulting container image by
importing and running it using:

# docker import wr-app-container-genericx86-64.tar.bz2 app-container
# docker run -it app-container /usr/bin/<your_app>

At this poing either with OverC or Docker you could push the container
to a registry such that it is avaible to other systems.

Image size
-------------------------

The image size will depend on your selected application. As with any
image, bitbake will include any dependencies in the image and as such
the size can easily grow. A small application with no/few dependencies
will result in a image of only a few MB.


Creating more than one app container
-------------------------

The use of the 'wr-app-container' and 'WR_APP_CONTAINER_APP' is
restricted to one application. However, you may use the
wr-app-container.inc in your own image recipe in a similar way
wr-app-container_*.bb does. This will allow you to write your own
application container images in only a few lines, and, any
improvements made to the wr-app-container.inc will immediately be
available in your image.
