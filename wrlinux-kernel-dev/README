wrlinux-kernel-dev layer
----------------

This layer should be used when working with a local clone
of the kernel tree in the git subdirectory. It should be added 
explicitly to your bblayers.conf and the bbappend updated with the
path to the local clone of choice.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux.  It
also assumes you are building a supported BSP layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building with the wrlinux-kernel-dev layer
-----------------------------
1. Add this layer and a corresponding BSP layer to your build's
   conf/bblayers.conf file
   
2. Add the desired feature templates to your conf/local.conf file
   WRTEMPLATE variable.

   * feature/kernel-dev : include kernel-dev and kernel-devsrc in SDK

   * feature/kernfeatures-clear : sets KERNEL_FEATURES=""
     (usually wanted for custom kernels)

   * feature/custom-kernel: use linux-yocto-custom.bb

NOTE: This layer is not indexed and therefor not available using
Wind River Linux's setup.sh.

NOTE: Wind River doesn't support enabling of external kernel
features when building with this layer.
