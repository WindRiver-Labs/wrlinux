wrlinux-kernel-dev layer
----------------

This layer should be used when working with a local clone
of the kernel tree in the git subdirectory. It should be added 
explicitly to your bblayers.conf and the bbappend updated with the
path to the local clone of choice.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux.  It
also assumes you are building a supported BSP layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Recipes
-------
1. linux-libc-headers-custom.bb is an example for using customers' kernel
   headers instead of the mainline official kernel headers. Note that
   linux-libc-headers-custom.bb provides linux-libc-headers when and only when
   KERNEL_HEADER_DIR is "/usr".

2. linux-yocto-dev.bbappend is for customizing Yocto kernel source and
   linux-yocto_%.bbappend for Wind River kernel source. If you want to use
   headers of these kernels, you need to properly set KERNEL_ALT_HEADER_DIR
   ("/usr" is invalid in this case).

3. linux-yocto-custom.bb is an example for using customers' kernel source. If
   you want to use kernel headers of linux-yocto-custom.bb, you need to properly
   set KERNEL_ALT_HEADER_DIR("/usr" is invalid in this case).

Templates
---------
1. feature/kernel-dev: includes kernel-dev and kernel-devsrc in SDK and sets
   KERNEL_HEADER_DIR ?= "/usr-alt"

2. feature/kernfeatures-clear: sets KERNEL_FEATURES = ""
   (usually wanted for custom kernels)

3. feature/kernel-alt-headers: sets KERNEL_ALT_HEADER_DIR ?= "/usr-alt"
   (enables installation of alternative userspace headers from the kernel to
   SDK)

4. feature/custom-kernel: use linux-yocto-custom.bb as virtual/kernel.
   COMPATIBLE_MACHINE needs to be manually set to expected machine type to avoid
   unexpectedly using it as virtual/kernel.


Building with the wrlinux-kernel-dev layer
-----------------------------
1. Add this layer and a corresponding BSP layer to your build's
   conf/bblayers.conf file

2. Add ENABLE_KERNEL_DEV = '1' to your conf/local.conf
   
3. Add the desired feature templates to your conf/local.conf file
   WRTEMPLATE variable.

NOTE: This layer is not indexed and therefor not available using
Wind River Linux's setup.sh.

NOTE: Wind River doesn't support enabling of external kernel
features when building with this layer.
