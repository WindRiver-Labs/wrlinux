Notes and Limitations:
======================

When the linux-libc-headers-custom package is enabled, it adds the ability
to use the customized kernel as the source for libc-headers. When
enabling this feature, the user is knowingly clobbering the supported and
tested toolchain headers and does so at their own risk.
    
This functionality is provided to support rapid development of kernel changes
that have coupled user space visible header files. Per-package additions to
the sysroot with selected / captured kernel headers is a more precise option
once active development has completed.
    
By default the standard/base branch of the kernel repository is used for the
exported headers. Additional layers can change this default.
    
Patching is explicitly disabled in this recipe, since header changes must be
coordinated with the running kernel and hence must be sourced from the same
repository to ensure they are in sync. Modifications should be pushed to the
master repository and the AUTOREV of the recipe will automatically pick up
changes.
    
The exported headers are used for both sysroot and SDK population and are
generated from the kernel's "headers_install" target.

Usage:
======
Add the lines to local.conf to enable it:
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_linux-libc-headers = "linux-libc-headers-custom"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_nativesdk-linux-libc-headers = "nativesdk-linux-libc-headers-custom"
WRTEMPLATE_append = "feature/kernel-dev"

Add the full path of the layer to bblayers.conf:
wrlinux/wrlinux-kernel-dev

Header files will finally be packaged into linux-libc-headers-custom-dev. To populate it into rootfs:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " linux-libc-headers-custom-dev"
