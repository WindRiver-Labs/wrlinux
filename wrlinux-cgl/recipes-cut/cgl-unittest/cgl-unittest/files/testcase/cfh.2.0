# Actually test node fencing feature
# There are two kinds of fencing: resource level and node level.
# 1. prepare two nodes to setup cluster
#    1) set up auto ssh
#    2) customize /etc/hosts and /etc/corosync/corosync.conf both
#       on local target and client
#    3) start corosync and pacemaker both on local target and client
# 2. enable stonith attribute
# 3. pick a fencing device for the node level fencing, use
#    "stonith -L" to check the list of stonith devices 
#    which are supported
# 4. configure the stonith resource
# 5. issue stonith operation
# 6. check the fencing operation, pass if the client reboots
