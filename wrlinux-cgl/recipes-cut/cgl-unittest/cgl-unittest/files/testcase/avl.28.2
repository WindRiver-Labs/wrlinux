#
# The case strategy as below:
# 1. check the file system image file which used to verify
#   dumpinfo is available or not
#   The file system image file generated in our build env as below
#   and will deploy to our target under /opt/cut/resource
#   Note: the img file avl.28.2.img which deploy to our target
#   actually generated under x86-64 system. So this case actually
#   only is reasonable under the target which is not x86-64 when
#   run this case
#   dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/cut/resource/avl.28.2.img bs=1M count=5
#   mkfs.ext4 /opt/cut/resource/avl.28.2.img
# 2. check the original dumpinfo file of the file system image
#   is available or not
#   The original dumpinfo file generated in our build env as below
#   and will deploy to our target under /opt/cut/resource
#   dumpe2fs /opt/cut/resource/avl.28.2.img &> \
#   /opt/cut/resource/avl.28.2.img_info
# 3. run dumpe2fs to check the shipped file system image file
#   and compare with the original dumpinfo, failed if the
#   infomation not the same

# Changelog
