clean()
{
        echo "Clean System..."
	<remove file and stop service>
        echo "Finish"
}

<command you should run>

result PASSED
exit0
***************************************************
***************************************************

Note:1) Must include "# description : ", behind this , you should write the test name, such as
        # description : SMM.7.1 Temperature Monitoring
        ./cgl_test will read this line and print out the name of test case.
     2) Must include ". $CUTDIR/function.sh" , some usefull function included in this file.
     3) Must include function clean(), remove the file that created in your test case and stop 
	the service. If no this function , test case will fail.
     4) Under function clean() , write your test case.
     5) If you use "result PASSED", please add "exit 0", in case some unexpected error.

b) Add shell script to test suite

  1) Copy your test case to network-cgl4/testcase and add execute permission
  2) Modify cgl_test
     Add test case name to parameter "TESTCASE".

Note: If this test case cover other one or two test, two steps should be done.
	
     1) Creat shell scripts and name them with covered test case name. Then write "# description : "
        in this file.
	e.g smm.7.2 and smm.7.3 is covered by smm.7.1
	echo "# description : SMM.7.2 Fan Monitoring" > smm.7.2
        echo "# description : SMM.7.3 Power Monitoring" > smm.7.3
	chmod 755 smm.7.2 smm.7.3
	
     2) Modify cover.conf as below

	smm.7.1:smm.7.2 smm.7.3

	smm.7.1 is the test case will be run, separated with ":" ,smm.7.2 and smm.7.3 are covered by smm.7.1.

c) If you want to use opensource test suite in your test case, you can copy it to network-cgl4,and modify Makefile to bulid it.
   such as rb-futext,it's a test suite for prf.1.6.

d) If you write test case by with C by yourself, put it in src and modify Makefile to build it.

e) If need some config file or other tar file in your shell test case, put these file in resource.
