Introduction
------------

This directory contains resources for configuring strongswan in order
to run the CUT ipsec test (ipsec.sh).  Test configuration is set by
values in the file ipsec_cut_config.sh.  This file is sourced by ipsec.sh
and by the script confGen.sh which is used to generate the ipsec.conf file
needed by strongswan.

The mode for the test is set in ipsec_cut_config.sh.  The default is "skip"
because to successfully run, we need the local target -- the one on which we
run the test -- and a remote target.  Both need to be manually configured
before the test is run.

General Setup
-------------

We need a local and a remote target.  They need not be on the same subnet,
but they do need to be visible to each other.  The addresses used by ipsec
can be on a physical device, like eth0, or addresses on either end of a
tunnel created by "ip tunnel add...".  We assume physical addresses.  There
is a script in this directory named makeTunnel.sh which can help you set up
a tunnel if you want to.

We could generate keys and certificates for each target, but it is not necessary
and it complicates the configuration, so we will not do it.  strongswan will
automatically generate and use self-signed certificates for each target.

There will probably be more than one IKE key manager installed on each target.
We use "systemctl" to make sure only one is active.  If your system is using
sysvinit, you will have to find and run the appropriate init scripts.

Local Setup
-----------

The local target should be running a cgl filesystem with the CUT tests included.
Login, then

lcl> cd /opt/cut/ipsec-strongswan
lcl> vi ipsec_cut_config.sh         # set IP addresses, etc
lcl> sh confGen.sh
lcl> cp ipsec.conf ipsec.secrets /etc

lcl> systemctl stop racoon
lcl> systemctl stop iked       # this service is for racoon2 and should not exist
lcl> systemctl stop spmd       # this service is for racoon2 and should not exist
lcl> systemctl restart strongswan

Remote Setup
------------

The remote target must have strongswan installed.  Using scp, copy ipsec.conf
and ipsec.secrets from the local target to /root on the remote target.  Login,
then

rmt> cp ipsec.conf ipsec.secrets /etc

rmt> systemctl stop racoon
rmt> systemctl stop iked
rmt> systemctl stop spmd
rmt> systemctl restart strongswan

Run The Test
------------

lcl> ipsec up toRemote    # optional -- this will tell you if the link is established
lcl> cd /top/cut
lcl> ./cgl_test -e ipsec.sh
