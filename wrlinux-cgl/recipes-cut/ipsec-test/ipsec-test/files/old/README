How to test:

1)change the related ip address to what you want: psk.txt is the key for each ip, setkey.conf 
is the ip policy 

2)copy the three files to /etc/racoon/

3)start racoon on both sides(/etc/init.d/racoon start).

4)reload policy use setkey:
setkey -f /etc/racoon/setkey.conf

5)ping another side(2) from one side(1).

6)on site 2, restart racoon
/etc/init.d/racoon restart

6)on 1,ping will hang for a moment and recovery again.


8) debug:
	a)check log: tail /var/log/message
        b)start directly and with debug: 
            racoon -F -d -f /etc/racoon/racoon.conf

sanity check:
1) error to parser the config:
   check the /etc/racoon/setkey.conf, ensure it correct.

2) setup the test bed tips:
   use your host as one site: config another ip for eth, and use it as ipsec peer.
   ifcofig eth0:1 192.168.127.3 . with this tips, the host can be pxe boot server
   and NFS root too.
