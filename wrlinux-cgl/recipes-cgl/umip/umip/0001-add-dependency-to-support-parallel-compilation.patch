Subject: [PATCH] add dependency to support parallel compilation

When "make -j10", the compilation will fail,
because scan.c has included gram.h, but gram.h was produced
after scan.c was compiled

So add this dependency to ensure that gram.h is produced
before scan.c is produced.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [upstream is not active]
