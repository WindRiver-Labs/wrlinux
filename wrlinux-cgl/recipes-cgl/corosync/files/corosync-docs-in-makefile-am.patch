commit afe26c94bac6a278013dd2a59d59c0b47f104080
Author: Aws Ismail <aws.ismail@windriver.com>

    This patch was taken initially from OE:
    
    http://git.openembedded.org/openembedded/commit/recipes/corosync/files/corosync-docs.patch?id=5486dcbf08200c22b6086d37055fb64de423eabe
    
    It had the following log:
    
       Update to 1.2.8
            Add corosync-docs.patch to fix html doc compilation
    
            Signed-off-by: Khem Raj <raj.khem@gmail.com>
    
    I have decided to update this patch to two related patches and update them
    for corosync v.1.4.3. This patch is now:
    1. corosync-docs-in-configure-ac.patch
    2. corosync-docs-in-makefile-am.patch
    
    This patch is also related to corosync-wr-no-html-docs.patch from WRL4.3
    which was dropped since this updated patch allows the build of docs
    to be optional.
