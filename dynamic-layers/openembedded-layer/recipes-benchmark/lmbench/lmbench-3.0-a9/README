WRLinux performance test with LMBench test suit

Test steps:
===========
[On build server]
1) $ setup.sh \
--machines=qemux86-64 --kernel=standard --templates=feature/test --distro=wrlinux

$ bitbake wrlinux-image-std

2) boot target
Roofs on local storage (such as harddisk) is strongly recommended for benchmark test.

[On target]
3) Test scripts are installed in /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench directory, read help info and setup necessary variables before testing.
$ /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/wr-lmbench-test.sh -h

4) run test
$ /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/wr-lmbench-test.sh

Test logs will be redirected into /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench/logs/ directory.

5) Analyze test logs.

Note: there are some variables used in /opt/benchmark/os/wr-lmbench script.
$LMBENCH_BIN_PATH:
The path where the lmbench binaries are, which is /usr/bin in wrlinux by default.

$MB:
The memory size (in megabytes) used for testing, which will be auto detected if not set.

$FSDIR:
Directory to create and delete temporary files used in the testing, default to /usr/tmp.

$SYNC_MAX:
The number of child processes running the same benchmark that should be run in parallel.
Default to 1 in this test.

$STAT:
A small temporary file used for some cases such as stat, fstat, open2close.

$HALF:
Half of the memory size used for testing, which is used by bcopy test case.

$FILE:
Regular file generated by lmdd and saved in TMPDIR, which is /usr/tmp/ by default.
It is used by mmap or file_read test cases.
