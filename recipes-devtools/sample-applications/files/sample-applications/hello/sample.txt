The Hello World as a User Project 
---------------------------------------------

This example shows how to use the build specs with a 
user-defined Makefile.

The respective SDK environment file has been sourced
into the environment, and includes for example:

  ${CC}       : the C compiler

  ${CXX}      : the C++ compiler

  ${CFLAGS}   : the C compiler flags

  ${CXXFLAGS} : the C++ compiler flags

  ${LDFLAGS}  : the Linker flags

  ${ARCH}     : arch, useful for kernel modules

  ${CROSS}    : cross-compiler, useful for kernel modules
