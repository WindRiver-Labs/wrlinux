The Penguin Program as a User Project 
-----------------------------------------

The Penguin program is a C++ version of the Ball program.

This example utilizes a user Makefile.

The Penguin program simulates a series of bouncing characters.
A variable named "grid" displays as a two-dimensional grid on
which the balls bounce. The balls are represented using an array
of ASCII characters. 

Three kinds of characters are simulated:
*  *A snowflake:* This character bounces off walls. The snowflake does
   not affect the other characters it collides with. The snowflake is
   represented by the character '*'.
*  *A bear:* This bear deflects any character it collides with. It is
   represented by the character 'b'.
*  *A penguin:* This character deflects and turns any character it 
   collides with. It is represented by the character '&lt;'.
