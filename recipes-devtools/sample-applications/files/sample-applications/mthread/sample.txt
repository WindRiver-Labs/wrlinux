The Multi-Thread Demonstration Program
--------------------------------------

The Multi-Thread program creates multiple pthreads
from a single process using the pthread_create()
function. It can be used with the tutorial
titled Multi-Thread Project to demonstrate
the debugging of multiple pthreads simultaneously.

See the Multi-Thread Tutorial for details on
running and debugging this program.
